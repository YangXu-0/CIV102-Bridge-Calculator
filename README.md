# CIV102-Bridge-Calculator

A couple of roughly written scripts intended to calculate the theoretical failure of a beam bridge (FOS, failure, shear force diagrams, bending moment diagrams, and location of flexural, shear, and buckling failures) and the midspan deflection when a train passes across it (case 1) and under two point loads (case 2) for the CIV102 final project.


As far as I know the math is all correct (matches all test calculations done by hand), but most of it was written in a few hours while being very sleep-deprived so who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

For any CIV102 students reading this, as tempting as it may be, don't plagiarize, but good luck.
