# CIV102-Bridge-Calculator

A couple of roughly written scripts intended to calculate the theoretical failure of a beam bridge (FOS, failure, shear force diagrams, bending moment diagrams, and location of flexural, shear, and buckling failures) and the midspan deflection when a train passes across it (case 1) and under two point loads (case 2).
